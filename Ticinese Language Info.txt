That story is written in Ticinese, a dialect of Western Lombard, part of the wider Gallo-Italic language group of northern Italy. The dialects of Ticino (the Italian-speaking Swiss canton) and nearby northern Lombardy evolved from Late Medieval Lombard, which diverged from Latin roughly between the 10th and 13th centuries.

Time Period of Use
Origins: Western Lombard forms (including the Ticinese variety) stabilized in recognizable form around 1200–1400 CE.

Active use: The specific Ticinese dialect you see in the story reflects how it was spoken from the mid‑1800s to early 1900s, especially in rural valleys.

Historical context: Many emigrants from Ticino and nearby Lombard valleys (like Varese, Lecco, and Como) came to the U.S. during precisely your family's timeframe — 1890–1915 — bringing that dialect with them.

Linguistic Features Noticed
Use of l’è (is) and la before verbs (personal pronouns carried into the verb form) — typical of Western Lombard.

Vocabulary like magna, formai, and murà closely match 19th‑century spoken Ticinese.

Pronunciation notes (such as söna) represent mid‑Varese and Locarno area speech, attested in oral collections from roughly 1850–1910.

So, if your family came from the southern Swiss valleys (Ticino) or northern Lombardy, and arrived in the U.S. around 1890–1910, this story’s dialect would be very close to what their elders likely spoke at home.

Would you like me to show a short side‑by‑side comparison between this Ticinese and standard Italian from that same period, to visualize the differences your ancestors might have heard daily?
