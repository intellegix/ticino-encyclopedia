description: "Research-powered performance optimization and code improvement"
---

Intelligent optimization that combines profiling with research-backed performance strategies.

**Workflow:**
1. **Profile** current performance (identify bottlenecks)
2. **Research** optimization techniques for your stack
3. **Analyze** code for anti-patterns and inefficiencies
4. **Benchmark** before optimization (establish baseline)
5. **Implement** research-backed optimizations
6. **Verify** improvements with benchmarks
7. **Document** changes and performance gains

**Usage:**
Describe what you want to optimize, and I'll use research integration to find the best strategies.

**Example:**
```
User: My React app is rendering slowly with large lists

Assistant will:
1. Analyze your component structure and state management
2. /research React performance optimization patterns virtualization large lists
3. Identify specific issues (unnecessary re-renders, missing memoization, etc.)
4. Research solutions: windowing/virtualization libraries, React.memo, useMemo
5. Implement optimizations (react-window, memoization, code splitting)
6. Add performance monitoring
7. Verify improvements with React DevTools Profiler
```

**Optimization Categories:**

**Frontend Performance:**
- React/Vue/Angular rendering optimization
- Bundle size reduction and code splitting
- Lazy loading and resource optimization
- Caching strategies (service workers, CDN)
- Image and asset optimization

**Backend Performance:**
- Database query optimization and indexing
- Caching layers (Redis, Memcached)
- API response time reduction
- Connection pooling
- Load balancing strategies

**Database Performance:**
- Query optimization and EXPLAIN analysis
- Index design and maintenance
- Denormalization strategies
- Read replicas and sharding
- Connection pool tuning

**Infrastructure Performance:**
- Container resource optimization
- Kubernetes autoscaling
- CDN configuration
- Caching strategies
- Load testing and capacity planning

**Research Integration:**
Automatically queries for:
- Framework-specific optimization guides
- Profiling tool recommendations
- Benchmark methodologies
- Real-world case studies
- Performance monitoring tools

**What to provide:**
- What aspect needs optimization (frontend, backend, database, infrastructure)
- Current performance metrics (if available)
- Specific bottlenecks or slow operations
- Your technology stack
- Performance targets (if any)

**Deliverables:**
- Performance analysis report
- Research-backed optimization recommendations
- Implemented code improvements
- Before/after benchmarks
- Monitoring setup for ongoing tracking
- Documentation of changes

**Common Optimization Targets:**
- Page load time reduction
- API response time improvement
- Database query performance
- Memory usage optimization
- Bundle size reduction
- First Contentful Paint (FCP) / Time to Interactive (TTI)
- Server response time (TTFB)

I'll combine deep analysis of your code with comprehensive research to deliver measurable performance improvements backed by best practices and real-world data.
