Subject: A Special Gift for You - Ticinese Language Encyclopedia

---

Dear Grandma,

I've created something very special for you - a Ticinese Language Encyclopedia!

This is a computer program that will help you explore your heritage language. It has:
- Over 1,200 Ticinese words with pronunciations
- 10 stories in Ticinese (you can hover your mouse over any word to see what it means!)
- The history of the Ticinese language and culture
- And much more!

DOWNLOAD THE FILE:
I've attached a ZIP file called "TicineseEncyclopedia_ForGrandma.zip"

INSTALLATION IS EASY:
1. Download the ZIP file from this email
2. Right-click the ZIP file and choose "Extract All"
3. Open the extracted folder
4. Double-click "INSTALL.bat"
5. Follow the simple instructions

A shortcut will appear on your desktop. Just double-click it whenever you want to use the encyclopedia!

IMPORTANT: You need Python installed on your computer
- If you don't have Python, I can help you install it
- Or download it from: https://www.python.org/downloads/
- Make sure to check "Add Python to PATH" when installing

NEED HELP?
Call me anytime! I'm happy to walk you through the installation over the phone.

Love,
Austin

P.S. There's a README.txt file in the folder with detailed instructions!
