description: "Research-powered debugging with comprehensive troubleshooting"
---

Intelligent debugging that combines code analysis with research-backed solutions.

**Workflow:**
1. **Analyze** the error/issue in your codebase
2. **Research** similar issues, known bugs, and solutions
3. **Diagnose** root cause with context from research
4. **Propose** multiple solution approaches with trade-offs
5. **Implement** the best solution
6. **Verify** fix with tests

**Usage:**
Describe your issue or paste error messages, and I'll use the research integration to find well-sourced solutions.

**Example:**
```
User: I'm getting "ECONNREFUSED" errors intermittently in production

Assistant will:
1. Analyze your codebase for connection handling
2. /research ECONNREFUSED errors in Node.js production environments troubleshooting
3. Check for common causes (connection pooling, DNS issues, firewall, etc.)
4. Propose solutions based on research + your specific context
5. Implement fixes with proper error handling
6. Add monitoring/logging for future diagnosis
```

**Capabilities:**
- Automatic research for error messages and stack traces
- Cross-reference with known issues in frameworks/libraries
- Security vulnerability checking
- Performance bottleneck identification
- Best practice validation

**Research Integration:**
Automatically queries Perplexity for:
- Error message patterns and solutions
- Framework-specific troubleshooting guides
- Security advisories and CVEs
- Performance profiling techniques
- Testing strategies for reproduction

**What to provide:**
- Error messages or unexpected behavior description
- Relevant code snippets or file paths
- Environment details (if applicable)
- What you've already tried (optional)

I'll handle the research, analysis, and implementation with comprehensive, well-sourced solutions.
