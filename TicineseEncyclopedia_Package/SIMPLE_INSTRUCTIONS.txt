Dear Nonna,

Here's how to get the Ticinese Encyclopedia working on your computer!

STEP 1: DOWNLOAD THE FILE

STEP 2: EXTRACT (UNZIP) THE FILE

Find the file you just downloaded

Choose "Extract All..."
Click "Extract"

A new folder will open with files inside

═══════════════════════════════════════════════

STEP 3: RUN THE ONE-CLICK INSTALLER

Inside the folder, you'll see a file called:
"INSTALL_COMPLETE.bat"

RIGHT-CLICK on it and choose "Run as administrator"

IMPORTANT: You MUST right-click and choose "Run as administrator"
(Don't just double-click it)

A black window will appear with green text
The installer will automatically:
